# Solder---RoboPCB

My PCB is in the shape of a robot head
It includes two LEDS and one motor
One LED is always on and changes britness based on light using a photoresistor
The other LED is attached to a button that turns on only when the button is presses
The motor is also connected to the button and has a potentiometer to control its power

Bill  of Materials:
  Battery Cell x1
  Potentiometer x1
  Push button x1
  Mini motor disc x1
  Photoresistor x1
  LED x2
  220 ohm resistor x1
